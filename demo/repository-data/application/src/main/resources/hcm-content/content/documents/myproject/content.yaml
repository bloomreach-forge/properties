                      <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has
                      roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000
                      years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in
                      Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a
                      Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical
                      literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections
                      1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and
                      Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of
                      ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum,
                      "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p>
