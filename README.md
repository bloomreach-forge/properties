# Properties Component

The properties component allows you to create simple CMS documents having a flat list of name/value pairs. 
It also provides easy locating and using these documents in your HST site frontend.

# Documentation 

Documentation is available at [onehippo-forge.github.io/properties](https://onehippo-forge.github.io/properties)

The documentation is generated by this command:

 > mvn clean site:site
 
The output is in the docs directory; push it and GitHub Pages will serve the site automatically.
